# cellular-ts

A small WebGL cellular automaton simulation I made to learn a little typescript. Cannibalized from my [personal website](https://benjdavis10.github.io/), which uses this as the backdrop. A little sloppy, probably inaccurate somewhere, but looks nice enough for my needs.

Install dependencies with npm, build with vite.
